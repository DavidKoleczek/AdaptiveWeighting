# AdaptiveWeighting

### This is the repository for the article Adaptive Weighting: Ensembling Forecasts AdaBoost-Style and More (MAKE THIS A LINK)

Code implementing AdaWeights and gradient descent and code to reproduce the various experiments and models can be found here. It was written and tested using Python 3.7.4 64-bit on Windows and a list of package requirements is provided in <code>requirements.txt</code>.

Algorithm implementations are in <code>optimization.py</code>.

Using these algorithms and how to recreate the experimental results using them is in the jupyter notebook <code>AdaWeighting.ipynb</code>.

Code to create the feature engineered datasets and models used to generate the predictions used can be found in <code>mk_datasets.py</code>

Code to generate the predictions can be found in <code>mk_predictions.py</code>

Code for creating the various figures used in this article is located in <code>Figures.ipynb</code>.
